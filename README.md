# Voting-Dapp-on-Ethereum
Welcome to My Project.
I am creating decentralised voting app on top of local ethereum blockchain.
Client side application will allow users to interact with smart contract and allow to vote on Decentralised App
Dapp will have client side application written in JS,HTML and CSS.
We will write smart contract, compile and deploy on local ethereum blockchain.
Client Side application - each candidate will have table of candidate with name, id , vote Count. we will have a form and select candidate we want to vote.
